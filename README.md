## Objectives

In descending order of significance (i.e. most important objective first):

1. **ungoogled-chromium is Google Chromium, sans dependency on Google web services**.
2. **ungoogled-chromium retains the default Chromium experience as closely as possible**. Unlike other Chromium forks that have their own visions of a web browser, ungoogled-chromium is essentially a drop-in replacement for Chromium.
3. **ungoogled-chromium features tweaks to enhance privacy, control, and transparency**. However, almost all of these features must be manually activated or enabled. For more details, see [Feature Overview](https://github.com/eloston/ungoogled-chromium#feature-overview).

## Differences from ungoogled-chromium

*These are the differences between a Linux build of ungoogled-chromium and ungoogled-chromium-android.*

* Disable/Remove Android specific functionalities:
   * Contextual search
   * Lite mode
   * Offline indicator
   * Prefetch
   * Home page links
   * Unnecessary account permissions
* Android specific enhancements:
   * Add `Startpage.com` and `Qwant.com` as search engine options
   * Add new folder button in bookmark manager
   * Add back flags to enable deprecated TLS warnings
   * Add flag to enable update notifications (disabled by default and will only send a single `GET` request to my server periodically)
   * Add flags to always send `save-data` flag in header
   * Add flags to force tablet UI and desktop mode
* Borrowed from Bromite:
   * Always incognito mode
   * Bookmark import/export options
   * Clear open tabs between sessions
   * Disable DRM media preprovisioning which leaks connections
   * DNS-over-https by default
   * Exit menu item
   * Prevent WebRTC address leaking
   * Proxy configuration
   * WebGL flag
* Borrowed from Vanadium:
  * Disable seed-based field trials
  * Disable media router
  * Disable metrics
  * Enable user-agent freeze
  * Enable split cache, partitioning connections, strict site isolation
  * Various compiling time enhancements
* All Google play and Google service related blobs are removed. This includes Firebase, GCM (Google Cloud Messaging), GMS (Google Mobile Services) and bridge to Google Play. 
* Releases are built for `arm`, `arm64` and `x86`. There is no `x86_64` build.

## Limitations

The enhancements included in ungoogled-chromium **are not to be considered useful for journalists, people living in countries with freedom limitations, and those who are facing government-level adversaries**. Please look at tools specifically developed for these purposes, for example [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/) in such cases.

## Platforms and Versions

Pre-built apks are named as `{BUILD_TARGET}_{CPU_ARCH}.apk`, where:
* `{BUILD_TARGET}` is one of `ChromeModernPublic`, `Trichrome`, `SystemWebview`.
  * `ChromeModernPublic` is for API >= 21 (Android 5.0) and only contains the browser.
  * `Trichrome` is for API >= 29 (Android 10) and only contains the browser. *Note: `Trichrome` has two apks, you need to install both for ungoogled-chromium to work.*
  * `SystemWebview` is for >= API 21 (Android 5.0) and only contains the webview.
* `{CPU_ARCH}` is one of `x86`, `arm` (armeabi-v7a), `arm64` (arm64-v8a).
* Please also read this [important note](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/android_webview/docs/build-instructions.md#Important-notes-for-N_P) about Webview on Android N-P.
* The [Bromite Wiki](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/wiki/Installing-SystemWebView) can also be helpful.

## Building Instructions
*This build is built from Sylvain Beucler's [libre Android rebuilds](https://android-rebuilds.beuc.net/) instead of SDK/NDK binaries from Google.*

* Clone this repository
* Make sure you have enough disk space and memory to build chromium
* enter repo directory and run `./build.sh`.
